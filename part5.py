# 3.4 Replot Luria and Delbrück’s experimental data 22 and 23. The data are in NTULearn ->
# Course -> Content and named LDexpt_22.csv and LDexpt_23.csv, respectively. What is
# the best fit you can get while fitting the data with a Poisson distribution? Below is how Luria
# and Delbrück plot the data and compare it to the theoretical prediction in their original paper.
# In your opinion, does the experimental data follow the expected distribution?
